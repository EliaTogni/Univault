# The cell
A cell is basically a watery solution of certain molecules, surrounded by a lipid (fat) membrane. The most important properties of a living cell (and, infact, of life itself) are the following: 
- it consists of a set of molecules that is separated from the exterior (as a human being is separated from his or her surroundings);
- it has a metabolism, that is, it can take up nutrients and convert them in to other molecules and usable energy. The cell uses nutrients to renew its constituents, to grow, and to drive its actions (just like a human does);
- It is able to (approximately) replicate, that is, produce offspring that resemble itself;
- it can react to its environment in a way that tends to prolong its own existence and the existence of a (preferably high) number of offspring.

# DNA
The major part of the heritable information of a cell is stored in the form of DNA molecules. They are called the cell's **genome**;
The chain of nucleotides has a direction, because its two ends are chemically different. Chemists denote its beginning as the $5'$-end and its end as the $3'$-end. The two directions are denoted by **upstream**, for "towards" the beginning, and **downstream**, for "towards" the end. Molecular chains of only a few nucleotides are called **oligonucleotides**.<br />
The complement of a DNA sequence is the sequence of the complements of its bases, but read in the reverse direction; complements are often called complementary DNA (cDNA).
The binding of two complementary DNA molecules is often referred to as **hybridization**.
The genomic DNA is indeed present in the form of a double helix of two complementary strands. Apart from the increased stability, this provides redundancy, which serves the cell in two ways. First, erroneous changes from one nucleotide to another, termed **point mutations**, can thereby be detected and corrected. Second, there is a natural way to duplicate the genome, which is necessary when the cell divides to produce two daughter cells.
The double helix is separated into two single strands of DNA, each of which then serves as a template for synthesizing its complement. Since the complement of a complement of a DNA sequence is again the primary sequence, the above procedure results in two faithful copies of the original double-stranded DNA.
In regular intervals, assemblies of proteins (called histones) bind to the DNA. The DNA double helix winds about one and a half times around each histone complex to form a **nucleosome**;
The nucleosomes themselves are usually packed on top of one another to form a more compact fibrous form called **chromatin**. An even higher level of packing is achieved by introducing loops into the chromatin fiber. The resulting structures, one for each genomic DNA molecule, are known as **chromosomes**.

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Genes
The importance of the genome is that it typically contains many genes. Although there is still debate about the exact definition, a **gene** can be thought of as a substring of the genome that is responsible for the production of one or a couple of types of RNA molecules.<br />
In the process of **gene expression**, the RNA is synthesized to be complementary to a part of the DNA template. As a result, each gene can control one or more properties of the organism, although often quite indirectly, as will become apparent below.<br />
Genes also include parts of DNA that are not copied into RNA. Most important, each gene contains a sequence called a **promoter**, which species the conditions under which RNA copies of certain parts of the gene are produced.<br />
Although **ribozymes** are responsible for a few very important tasks in cells, the purpose of the vast majority of genes in a cell is to encode building instructions for proteins.
The RNA molecules involved in this process are called **messenger RNAs**, or **mRNAs**.

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Proteins
**Proteins** are polymers composed of **amino acids**. Cells use 20 different types of amino acids for protein synthesis.<br />
Proteins are also sometimes called **polypeptides**.
Each amino acid also has a third group, the **side chain**. The side chains of the $20$ natural amino acids show very different chemical properties.<br />
Due to the diversity of the side chains, this allows for the generation of a huge variety of patterns of physicochemical properties on protein surfaces.

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Expression of Genes and Proteins
One of the most fundamental processes in the cell is the production (and disposal) of proteins. Below, the life cycle of proteins is outlined for eukaryotic cells:
1) **transcription**: messenger RNA (mRNA) copies of a gene are produced. The products, called pre-mRNAs are complementary to the DNA sequence;
	1) **initiation**: certain proteins, called **transcription factors** (**TFs**),bind to **TF binding sites** in the gene promoters in the DNA;
