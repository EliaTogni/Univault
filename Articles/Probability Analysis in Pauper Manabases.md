## What's this article about?
This piece is mostly designed for those new to deckbuilding or looking to deepen their understanding of deckbuilding fundamentals. The focus of this article is crafting effective mana bases, analyzing deck decisions, calculating colored mana sources and land counts, and taking into account cantrips.

While aiming for accessibility, the author has chosen to prioritize practical guidance over strict mathematical precision, which means he sometimes blends probabilities and percentages to keep the discussion flowing. Please note that some technical liberties are taken for the sake of clarity.

Apa has added a Sources section at the end of the article, and will expand on this if he finds new information or receive corrections, in hoping that this article will be helpful for future deckbuilders or deck tuners

## Trade-offs
In Magic: the Gathering, building an effective mana base requires careful consideration of various **trade-offs**, especially when dealing with multiple colors. Each format presents its unique challenges and strategies. Here are some examples in eternal formats:
- **Modern Format**: In Modern, opting for a three or more colored deck usually means including fetchlands (lands that search for specific land types for $1$ life), shocklands (lands that can enter untapped at the cost of $2$ life), and triomes (lands offering three colors but always enter tapped). These choices can lead to either a loss of life or slower gameplay, weakening these decks against aggressive strategies. For example, starting a game with reduced life or using lands that enter tapped could put you at a tempo disadvantage against fast decks;
- **Legacy Format**: Legacy decks with three or more colors might use fetchlands and dual lands (lands with two basic types that enter untapped), avoiding the downsides of life loss and tapped lands seen in Modern. However, this opens them up to attacks on their nonbasic lands through "land hate" cards like Wasteland and Moon effects (like Blood Moon and Magus of the Moon), which can disrupt their mana availability. Conversely, mono-color decks, such as Mono Red Goblins, can leverage "sol lands" (Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors) for a [[Tempo|tempo]] advantage and include value lands like Cavern of Souls and Den of the Bugbear, while keeping 5 basics in their deck. This deck even plays Blood Moon in the sideboard! This gives them speed, resilience and value, underscoring the intrinsic benefits of mono-color builds.

In Pauper, the tradeoff is much more evident, since all the lands that add more than one color of mana enter the battlefield tapped or have other tempo disadvantages (Crystal Grotto only filters mana or adds colorless, Survivor’s Encampment requires a creature to tap). That means, in Pauper the tempo hit of playing a multicolored deck is bigger, since it means that it will play a high number of taplands, and an aggressive mono colored deck will play most or all untapped lands, thus being able to play a turn faster in a high number of scenarios:
- **mono colored decks**: as an example, Mono Red Kuldotha plays $17$ or sometimes $18$ lands, of which $4$ are Great Furnace and the remainder basic Mountains; this means that as long as it draws lands and spells in a good ratio, it will be able to play on curve without spending time setting up its mana. Moreover, the Great Furnaces work as a value land for cards like Kuldotha Rebirth, Goblin Tomb Raider and Galvanic Blast;
- **two color decks**: on the other hand, a two color deck like Dimir Faeries plays a total of $18$ lands + $4$ Lórien Revealed (for the purposes of this article, I will take Lórien Revealed and other landcyclers as a full land that enters tapped with value in the late game), of which $11$ are basic lands that enter untapped, and the other $11$ lands enter tapped, and it plays a total of $6$ value lands (Lórien, Dimir Aqueduct and Bojuka Bog). Dimir Faeries normally has to play the first couple of turns setting up its mana, and with only one basic swamp, normally it doesn’t have access to untapped black without having to use its resources to set up having access to it.
