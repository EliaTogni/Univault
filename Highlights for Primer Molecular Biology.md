# The cell
A cell is basically a watery solution of certain molecules, surrounded by a lipid (fat) membrane. The most important properties of a living cell (and, infact, of life itself) are the following: 
- it consists of a set of molecules that is separated from the exterior (as a human being is separated from his or her surroundings);
- it has a metabolism, that is, it can take up nutrients and convert them into other molecules and usable energy. The cell uses nutrients to renew its constituents, to grow, and to drive its actions (just like a human does);
- It is able to (approximately) replicate, that is, produce offspring that resemble itself;
- it can react to its environment in a way that tends to prolong its own existence and the existence of a (preferably high) number of offspring.

## DNA
The major part of the heritable information of a cell is stored in the form of DNA molecules. They are called the cell's **genome**;
The chain of nucleotides has a direction, because its two ends are chemically different. Chemists denote its beginning as the $5'$-end and its end as the $3'$-end. The two directions are denoted by **upstream**, for "towards" the beginning, and **downstream**, for "towards" the end. Molecular chains of only a few nucleotides are called **oligonucleotides**.<br />
The complement of a DNA sequence is the sequence of the complements of its bases, but read in the reverse direction; complements are often called **complementary DNA** (**cDNA**).<br />
The binding of two complementary DNA molecules is often referred to as **hybridization**.<br />
The genomic DNA is indeed present in the form of a double helix of two complementary strands. Apart from the increased stability, this provides redundancy, which serves the cell in two ways. First, erroneous changes from one nucleotide to another, termed **point mutations**, can thereby be detected and corrected. Second, there is a natural way to duplicate the genome, which is necessary when the cell divides to produce two daughter cells.<br />
The double helix is separated into two single strands of DNA, each of which then serves as a template for synthesizing its complement. Since the complement of a complement of a DNA sequence is again the primary sequence, the above procedure results in two faithful copies of the original double-stranded DNA.
In regular intervals, assemblies of proteins (called histones) bind to the DNA. The DNA double helix winds about one and a half times around each **histone** complex to form a **nucleosome**;
The nucleosomes themselves are usually packed on top of one another to form a more compact fibrous form called **chromatin**. An even higher level of packing is achieved by introducing loops into the chromatin fiber. The resulting structures, one for each genomic DNA molecule, are known as **chromosomes**.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Genes
The importance of the genome is that it typically contains many genes. Although there is still debate about the exact definition, a **gene** can be thought of as a substring of the genome that is responsible for the production of one or a couple of types of RNA molecules.<br />
In the process of **gene expression**, the RNA is synthesized to be complementary to a part of the DNA template. As a result, each gene can control one or more properties of the organism, although often quite indirectly, as will become apparent below.<br />
Genes also include parts of DNA that are not copied into RNA. Most important, each gene contains a sequence called a **promoter**, which species the conditions under which RNA copies of certain parts of the gene are produced.<br />
Although **ribozymes** are responsible for a few very important tasks in cells, the purpose of the vast majority of genes in a cell is to encode building instructions for proteins.<br />
The RNA molecules involved in this process are called **messenger RNAs**, or **mRNAs**.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Proteins
**Proteins** are polymers composed of **amino acids**. Cells use 20 different types of amino acids for protein synthesis.<br />
Proteins are also sometimes called **polypeptides**.
Each amino acid also has a third group, the **side chain**. The side chains of the $20$ natural amino acids show very different chemical properties.<br />
Due to the diversity of the side chains, this allows for the generation of a huge variety of patterns of physicochemical properties on protein surfaces.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Expression of Genes and Proteins
One of the most fundamental processes in the cell is the production (and disposal) of proteins. Below, the life cycle of proteins is outlined for eukaryotic cells:
1) **transcription**: messenger RNA (mRNA) copies of a gene are produced. The products, called pre-mRNAs are complementary to the DNA sequence;
	1) **initiation**: certain proteins, called **transcription factors** (**TFs**), bind to **TF binding sites** in the gene promoters in the DNA;
	2) **elongation**: the mRNA copy of the gene is synthesized by a special protein (RNA polymerase II). It moves along the DNA and thereby sequentially extends the pre-mRNA by linking a nucleotide complementary to that found in the DNA;
	3) **termination**: A signal in the DNA causes the transcription to end and the mRNA to be released.
2) **splicing**: parts of the pre-mRNA, which are called **introns**, are removed. The remaining parts, called **exons**, are reconnected to form the mature mRNA. The spliced mRNAs travel from the nucleus (through huge, selective pores in its double membrane) into the cytosol;
3) **translation**: In the cytosol, ribosomes await the mRNAs. Ribosomes synthesize proteins as specified by **codons**, triplets of consecutive nucleotides, in the mRNA;
	1) **iniziation**: the ribosome finds a **start codon** (usually, the first AUG subsequence that has favorable neighboring nucleotides) in the mRNA;
	2) **elongation**: one by one, the ribosome attaches amino acids to the growing polypeptide (protein) chain. In each step, the ribosome translates the current codon into an amino acid according to the genetic code. The ribosome then moves to the next codon in the same **reading frame**, that is, to the next adjacent nonoverlapping codon;
	3) **termination**: translation is stopped by any of three different **stop codons** encountered in the current reading frame.
4) **degradation**: almost all proteins are eventually destroyed by digestion into their individual amino acids.

The process of splicing implies complex gene structures composed of alternating introns and exons.

![[genome.png]]

At the top of the figure, a section of a genome is shown that contains a gene. Important features of the gene are the promoter containing several TF binding sites and the transcribed region, which is partitioned into exons and introns. After transcription, the pre-mRNA (not shown) is spliced: the introns are cut out; thus, the mature mRNA is the concatenation of the exons. Only a part of the mRNA encodes a protein.

Steps $1$ and $2$ of the scheme described above are called **gene expression**, while steps $1$ through $5$ are called **protein expression**. The term **expression level** of a molecule type is (a bit imprecisely) used to refer to either its current abundance in the cell, or to the rate of synthesis of new molecules.

The cellular concentration of any type of protein can be infuenced by changing the efficiencies of the above steps. This is called **regulation of expression**. While cells in fact regulate each of the above steps, the main point for the quantitative control of protein expression is certainly transcription initiation. In addition to the general TFs, which are always required for initiation, there are additional TFs which modify the probability or speed of transcription. They bind to short DNA motifs, for obvious reasons called **enhancers** and **silencers**, in the promoter.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Evolution
The complexity of cells and organisms has evolved over several billion years of interplay of mutation and selection. Here, mutation means any kind of modification of the heritable information of reproductive cells. The totality of heritable information giving rise to an organism is called its **genotype**, as opposed to **phenotype**, which subsumes the observable physical properties of the organism. Differences in the genotype sometimes manifest in different phenotypes; otherwise, the corresponding mutations are said to be **silent**. **Selection** refers to the fact that the phenotypic changes may lead to differential reproductive success; this may correlate with the organism's ability to survive in its environment. Often, however, mutations have no or a negligible impact on survival and reproduction.<br />
Several different genotypes may then coexist in a population. In this case, their genetic differences are called **polymorphisms**. There are several different types of mutations. The simplest is the **point mutation** or **substitution**; here, a single nucleotide in the genome is changed. In the case of polymorphisms, they are called **single nucleotide polymorphisms** (**SNPs**). Other types of mutations include the following:
1) **insertion**: a piece of DNA is inserted into the genome at a certain position;
2) **deletion**: a piece of DNA is cut from the genome at a certain position;
3) **inversion**: a piece of DNA is cut, flipped around and then re-inserted, thereby converting it into its complement;
4) **translocation**: a piece of DNA is moved to a different position;
5) **duplication**: a copy of a piece of DNA is inserted into the genome.

Thereby mutations can increase the genetic diversity of a population, that is, the number of present polymorphisms.

# Molecular Biology Measurement Data
## Sequence Data
The classic molecular biology data type is the sequence (more precisely, the DNA sequence). The process of "measuring" the sequence of nucleotides in a piece of DNA is called **sequencing** and is presently highly automated.<br />
The sequencing process requires a huge number of identical DNA molecules. These can be gained from a small sample by **amplication** through the **polymerase chain reaction** (**PCR**).

The DNA is first split into parts which are sequenced separately. The resulting set of sequences must be computationally assembled into the contiguous genome.<br />
Although techniques for the determination of protein sequences exist, it is nowadays common to sequence mRNAs or complete genomes, and then compute the translation products.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Gene Expression Data
Gene expression data usually come in the form of a **matrix of expression levels** for a number of genes in a range of cell samples. There are quite a few technologies available to measure the level of expression of a large number of genes simultaneously. We focus on **microarrays**, which are presently the most popular technology for large-scale gene expression measurement.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Microarrays
Microarrays, sometimes also called DNA chips, employ hybridization to distinguish different genes, and therefore require that the sequences of genes to be measured be known in advance. Infact, a microarray is essentially a surface with a known location (called **spot**) for each gene to be measured.<br />
At each spot, cDNA fragments are fixed which are complementary to a (transcribed) subsequence of a gene. Ideally, the subsequences are determined in such a way that they are specific to the corresponding gene, that is, they are not similar to the complement of any other mRNA that is expected to occur in the sample.

The measurement of a sample with a microarray  (jargon: hybridization) begins by reverse-transcribing the mRNAs of a cell sample to cDNA. The cDNAs are labeled to make them detectable, for instance, by incorporating fluorescing or radioactive tags. Then, the sample is administered onto the microarray, and a number of cDNAs from the sample hybridize to the corresponding spot. This number is approximately proportional to the respective mRNA concentration in the sample. After washing the array the concentration can be determined by measuring, at the corresponding spot, the intensity of the signal emitted by the molecular labels.

Background noise is present due to incomplete washing and nonspecific hybridization. Moreover, due to varying efficiencies of the intermediary steps of the measurement, and to varying amounts of mRNA per cell, the results obtained with different microarrays or for different samples are not likely to be on the same scale. Normalization should therefore be applied.

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Bioinformatics Challenges
Modern molecular biologists measure huge amounts of data of various types. The intention is to use these data to:
1) reconstruct the past (e.g., infer the evolution of species);
2) predict the future (e.g., predict how someone will respond to a certain drug);
3) guide biological engineering (such as improving the effciency of brewer's yeast).

## Genome Structure Analysis
The analysis of DNA sequences can be organized into a small tree. It contains at least three "grand challenge" problems:
- **genome comparison**: the goal of this discipline is to reconstruct the evolutionary history, that is, the series of genome rearrangements, that led to different species. A diffculty is that the phylogeny and the common ancestors must be inferred on the basis of genomes of present-day species;
- **genending**: this includes the identication of the gene structure, that is, the arrangement of the gene's elements. In computer science terms, the problem is to label substrings of the DNA;
- **understanding transcriptional regulation**: here the goal is to quantitatively predict the expression levels of genes from the details of their promoters and the present quantities of TFs.

All tasks are complicated by the fact that (presumably) by far not all functional DNA motifs are known by now.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Relation of Molecular to Macroscopic Data
It is most interesting to identify the molecular causes of macroscopic events or states, because this understanding allows for a directed search for ways to cause or prevent such events and to maintain or change such states.<br />
Three classes of tasks emerge from this general problem statement:
- **population genetics**: the strategy in population genetics is to find chromosomal regions that are inherited along with heritable traits; such regions can be supposed to contain genes responsible for those traits;
- **diagnosis**: as an example, it is desirable to be able to base the diagnosis of certain diseases on gene expression patterns. For diseases that are hard to recognize or distinguish by classic means (e.g., histology), this can potentially be less subjective and ambiguous;
- **therapy optimization**: here, the idea is that every individual is different and that optimal treatment may be derived from molecular data: the efficacy of drugs may be predicted on the basis of the genotype of a pathogen. The interplay of the genotype (SNPs) of the patient with that of the pathogen should be taken into account;
- **target finding**: this essentially amounts to applying feature selection to a successful prediction of a disease (diagnosis);
- **systems biology**: the goal is nothing less than to quantitatively simulate entire cells (or large subsystems).
